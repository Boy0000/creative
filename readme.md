A resource-pack library for Minecraft: Java Edition, the resource pack system
provides a way to customize textures, models, sounds, translations, splashes,
credits, and fonts without modifying the default Minecraft client

This library lets programmers safely create resource-packs, instantly find
bugs in the resource-pack and create the most compact version of your
resource-pack
